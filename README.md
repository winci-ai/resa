In this paper, we propose the positive-feedback SSL framework. It involves the model generating representations that possess semantically clustering information. This clustering information is leveraged to design self-supervised loss function, which is then employed to more effectively guide the model's learning process.

## Method
ReSA is built under positive-feedback SSL framework, which directly leverages the stable and semantically meaningful clustering properties of the encoderâ€™s outputs. Through an online self-clustering mechanism, ReSA refines its own
objective during training, outperforming state of-the-art SSL baselines and achieving higher efficiency.
