## Method
ReSA is built under positive-feedback self-supervised Learning framework, which directly leverages the stable and semantically meaningful clustering properties of the encoder’s outputs. Through an online self-clustering mechanism, ReSA refines its own
objective during training, outperforming state of-the-art SSL baselines and achieving higher efficiency.
